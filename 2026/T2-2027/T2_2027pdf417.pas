    {During most printing processes, there is a tendency for the ink or toner to spread slightly.
     This means that when you print a PDF417 symbol, the black modules tend to end up slightly
      wider than expected, and the white modules slightly narrower. The encoder allows you to compensate
       for this ink spread by "shaving" the black modules. Choosing a non-zero value for the horizontal
        "shaving" amount, for example, causes the encoder to lay the symbol out using the specified module
         width, but then change part of each black module back to white.
The amount of shaving required depends entirely on the printing process and the type of stock being used.
With laser printers, this effect is minimal, and can usually be ignored. With inkjet printers, particularly
on low-quality paper stock, the amount of ink spread can be significant. You may need to experiment
to determine an appropriate setting.
You can determine the appropriate amount of horizontal shaving by printing a symbol with no shaving (zero)
and with one pixel's worth of shaving. Look at the black and white vertical bars in the start patterns
of both symbols, and choose the value for which the black and white bars are closest to the same width.
In the vertical direction, again try with and without one pixel of shaving. If using one pixel's worth
of shaving introduces a gap between successive rows of the symbol, go back to zero.
Only in the rarest of cases should you ever need more than one pixel's worth of shaving}
